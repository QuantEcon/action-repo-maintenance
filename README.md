> ‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT** - This action is under active development. Features and APIs may change as we iterate on the implementation.

A GitHub Action for automating maintenance tasks across QuantEcon repositories.

## Overview

This action automates routine maintenance tasks for the QuantEcon organization on GitHub, starting with repository backups and expandable to other maintenance operations.

## Features

### üîÑ Repository Backup (In Development)

Automatically backs up QuantEcon repositories to AWS S3 for disaster recovery and compliance.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Pattern-based repository selection using regex (e.g., `lecture-.*`)
- Automated backup to AWS S3 bucket
- Configurable backup schedules
- Support for incremental and full backups
- Backup verification and reporting

## Configuration

Create a `config.yml` file in your workflow directory:

```yaml
backup:
  enabled: true
  patterns:
    - "lecture-.*"
    - "quantecon-.*"
  s3:
    bucket: "quantecon-repo-backups"
    region: "us-east-1"
    prefix: "backups/"
```

See `config.example.yml` for a complete configuration example.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- AWS credentials configured (for S3 backups)
- GitHub token with appropriate permissions

## Usage

### As a GitHub Action

```yaml
name: Repository Maintenance
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday at 2 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  backup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - uses: quantecon/action-repo-maintenance@v1
        with:
          task: backup
          config: .github/config.yml
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```
